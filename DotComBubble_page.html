            <h1>Dot Com Bubble </h1>
            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>The dot-com bubble, also known as the Internet bubble, refers to the period between 1995 and 2000 when investors injected money into Internet-based startups in the hope that these young companies would soon turn a profit. Speculative investments in dotcoms (named after the ".com" domain used by companies doing business on the Internet) led to 4,444 stock markets higher. The technology-driven NASDAQ Composite Index increased from less than 1,000 in 1995 to a high of 5,408.60 on March 10, 2000.</p>

            <h3>Understanding the Dot-Com Bubble:</h3>
            <img style='float:left;width:290px;height:260px; margin-right:10px;' src="images/com.png" />
            <p>The dot-com bubble is also tied to the NASDAQ Composite Index, which rose 582% from 751.49 to 5,132.52 between January 1995 and March 2000, gains since the bubble began. Several technology and online companies went bankrupt and faced liquidation, namely Pets.co., Webvan, 360Networks, Boo.com, eToys, etc. However, other internet companies struggled, survived and are now giants, notably Microsoft, Amazon. , eBay, Qualcomm and Cisco. </p>
            <p> Internet companies' stock prices rose much faster and higher than their real-sector competitors, largely due to speculation about the excitement and euphoria of the new Internet age. As a result, this has led to an overvaluation of Internet companies across the market relative to their intrinsic value. The bursting of the bubble caused a panic in the market with massive sales of dot-com stocks, further depressing their value, and in 2002 investor losses were estimated at around $ 5 trillion.</p>

            <h3>Characteristics of the Dotcom Era:</h3>
            <img style='float:left;width:250px;height:250px; margin-right:10px;' src="images/com1.jpg" width="20%" height="20%">
            <p> The Internet-based stock buying frenzy was overwhelming when many Internet-based companies called dotcoms were founded. Since they were in a fairly high-growth industry, they needed funding. Funding was provided primarily by venture capitalists. Individual investors and lenders later followed. Rather than focus on fundamental analysis of the company, which includes the company's revenue-generating potential and business plans, industry analysis, market trend analysis, and P / E ratio, many Investors focused on wrong metrics, such as their website traffic growth, driven by start-ups. </p>
            <p>Most startups have not implemented viable business models such as generating cash flows; therefore, they were overrated and highly speculative. It culminated in a bubble that grew rapidly over several years. These companies received an outrageous rating and their share prices continued to rise due to overwhelming demand. Therefore, the bursting of the bubble was inevitable, causing a market crash that was most noticeable on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. The collapse of the dot-com bubble was a shocking event that led to stock sell-offs as demand declined and risk financing constraints increased the rate of recession</p>
            <p>The collapse also resulted in massive layoffs in the tech sector, as it was unavoidable. The dot-com bubble began to collapse in 1999 and the decline occurred between March 2000 and 2002. Several technology companies that were publicly traded during the time went bankrupt or were acquired by other companies. Others hung by a thread when their stocks fell to such low levels that they were not even considered. </p>

            <h3>Causes of the dotcom collapse:</h3>
            <img style='float:left;width:350px;height:300px; margin-right:10px;' src="images/burst.jpg"/>
            <p> The cause of the dotcom bubble can be traced back to the following factors:</p>
            <p> 1. Overvaluation of dotcom companies Most of the technology and Internet companies that IPOs during the era of dotcoms were due to increased demand and a lack of robust pricing models. High multipliers were used in tech company reviews, resulting in unrealistic values that were overly optimistic. 4,444 analysts did not focus on the fundamental analysis of these companies and revenue generation opportunities were overlooked due to the focus on non-value-added website traffic metrics. Research conducted revealed over 40% overvaluation of dotcom companies when examining their P / E ratios. </p>
            <p>2. Abundance of venture capital Funds intended for venture capitalists and other investors in technology and The Internet were one of the main contributors to the dot-com bubble. In addition, cheap funds, which can be obtained at very low interest rates, made capital easily accessible. Coupled with fewer barriers to obtaining financing for Internet companies, this led to massive investments in the sector that expanded the bubble even further. 3. Media Frenzy Media companies encouraged people to invest in risky tech stocks by spreading overly optimistic expectations of future returns and the mantra "grow big fast." Trade publications, such as The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Bloomberg, and many investment analysis publications, fueled demand through their media by lighting a blazing fire and further inflating the bubble. Alan Greenspan's speech on "irrational exuberance" in December 1996 also provided the impetus for growth and technological momentum. </p>
